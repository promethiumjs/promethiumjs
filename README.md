# PromethiumJS
*Yet Another JavaScript Framework*

PromethiumJS is a framework that is built on top of [nqtui](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtui) (which is 
built on top of lit-html) and [nqtx](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtx).
It aims to be a JavaScript application framework that makes it easy to build complex web apps.

PromethiumJS is still however under development and is not ready to be used in projects at the moment.
For the meantime, you can check out [nqtui](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtui) and 
[nqtx](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtx).They're both undergoing a substantial API change and are 
also not recommended for use at the moment, but their documentation, which reflects their new APIs are 
currently in development and can be accessed through their GitHub wikis.
